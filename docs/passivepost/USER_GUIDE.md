## 1. Getting Started

### First Time Setup

When you first log into PassivePost, you'll be guided through an onboarding wizard that walks you through 4 steps:

1. **Welcome** — A quick introduction to what PassivePost does
2. **Connect an Account** — Link your first social media account
3. **Set Your Brand Voice** — Tell PassivePost about your business
4. **Generate Your First Post** — Create your first AI-generated post

After completing the wizard, you'll land on the Overview dashboard.

### The Overview Dashboard

This is your home base. Here's what you'll see:

- **Usage Progress Bars** — How much of your daily/monthly limits you've used
- **Quick Stats** — Posts created, accounts connected, AI generations used
- **Coaching Card** — A daily tip, strategy, or motivational message
- **Quick Generate Button** — One-click AI content creation

---

## 2. Setting Up Your Brand Voice

Your brand voice is the most important setting in PassivePost. It tells the AI how to write content that sounds like you and your business.

### How to Set It Up

1. Go to **Brand Voice** in the sidebar (under Setup)
2. Fill in each field:

| Field | What to Enter | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Tone** | How you want to sound | "Friendly and professional" |
| **Niche** | Your business category | "Plumbing" |
| **Location** | Where you operate | "Austin, TX" |
| **Sample URLs** | Links to your website or content you like | "https://myplumbing.com" |
| **Target Audience** | Who you're trying to reach | "Homeowners aged 30-55 in the Austin area" |
| **Posting Goals** | What you want social media to do for you | "Get more service calls and build local trust" |
| **Preferred Platforms** | Where you want to focus | Twitter, Facebook |
| **Post Frequency** | How often you want to post | "Daily" or "3 times per week" |

3. Click **Save**

### Why It Matters

Every piece of AI-generated content uses these settings. A plumber in Austin will get very different content than a photographer in New York. The more detail you provide, the better the AI performs.

### Changing Your Brand Voice

You can update your brand voice at any time. Changes take effect immediately for all future AI generations.

## 3. Connecting Social Accounts

2. Click the **Connect** button for the platform you want
3. You'll be redirected to the platform's login page
4. Authorize PassivePost to manage your account
5. You'll be redirected back — your account is now connected

### Currently Supported for Connection

### How Many Accounts Can I Connect?

It depends on your plan:
- **Starter**: 2 platforms
- **Basic**: 3 platforms
- **Premium**: All 10 platforms

---

## 4. Generating AI Content

### Quick Generate (Recommended)

The fastest way to create content:

1. Click the **Quick Generate** button (floating button, bottom-right of any page)
2. A dialog opens with your AI-generated post
3. Review the content
4. Choose to:
   - **Copy** to clipboard
   - **Schedule** it for a specific date/time
   - **Post immediately**
   - **Generate again** if you want a different version

### From the Posts Page

1. Go to **Posts** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Post**
3. Choose to write manually or generate with AI
4. Select the target platform(s)
5. Set a schedule or save as draft
6. Click **Save** or **Schedule**

### Tips for Better AI Content

- **Be specific in your brand voice settings** — "Friendly plumber who cares about families" gets better results than "professional"
- **Choose the right niche** — The niche guidance tells the AI what vocabulary and topics to use
- **Add sample URLs** — The AI can reference your website's style
- **Include images** — The AI can generate captions based on photos you upload (multimodal support)

### How Many Posts Can I Generate?

Your daily AI generation limit depends on your plan:
- **Starter**: 5 per day
- **Basic**: 10 per day
- **Premium**: 100 per day

## 5. Managing Posts

### The Posts Page

This is your post management hub. You can:

- **View all posts** — See everything you've created, sorted by date
- **Filter** — Narrow down by platform, status, or date range
- **Search** — Find specific posts by content
- **Bulk actions** — Select multiple posts to delete or reschedule

### Post Statuses

| Status | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Draft** | Saved but not scheduled yet |
| **Scheduled** | Set to publish at a specific time |
| **Queued** | In the publishing queue, waiting to be sent |
| **Posted** | Successfully published to the platform |
| **Failed** | Something went wrong — check the error message |

### Editing a Post

1. Click on any post to open the detail view
2. Make your changes
3. Click **Save**

### Deleting Posts

- Click the delete icon on any post, or
- Select multiple posts and use the bulk delete action

---

## 6. Using the Queue

### What the Queue Shows

The Queue page displays all posts that are scheduled to be published, ordered by time. Think of it as your "upcoming posts" view.

### Managing the Queue

- **Reorder** — Change the order posts will go out
- **Edit** — Make last-minute changes before publishing
- **Cancel** — Remove a post from the queue without deleting it
- **View timing** — See exactly when each post is scheduled to publish

### How Posts Get Published

When a post's scheduled time arrives, PassivePost automatically sends it to the platform. If the post fails (e.g., the platform is down), it retries up to 3 times before marking it as failed.

---

## 7. Content Calendar

### What You'll See

A month-view calendar with your posts plotted on each day. It gives you a bird's-eye view of your content plan.

### Calendar Features

- **Hover over a date** — See a tooltip with how many posts are scheduled per platform
- **Click a date** — View all posts for that day
- **Color indicators** — Different colors for different post statuses
- **Navigate months** — Arrow buttons to move forward and back

### Using the Calendar for Planning

The calendar helps you:
- Spot gaps in your posting schedule
- Ensure you're posting consistently
- Balance content across platforms
- Plan ahead for holidays, events, or promotions

---

## 8. Tracking Engagement

### The Engagement Page

Shows how your published posts are performing across all connected platforms.

### Metrics Tracked

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Likes** | How many people liked/favorited your post |
| **Shares** | How many times your post was shared/retweeted |
| **Comments** | How many people replied to your post |
| **Impressions** | How many times your post was shown |
| **Reach** | How many unique people saw your post |

### Charts and Insights

- **Engagement over time** — Line chart showing trends
- **Platform comparison** — Bar chart comparing performance across platforms
- **Top posts** — Your best-performing content
- **Best times** — When your audience is most active

### How Data is Collected

PassivePost automatically pulls engagement data from your connected platforms. The default is once every 24 hours, but your admin can adjust this frequency.

---

## 9. Finding Leads

### The Leads Page

Surfaces potential customers or business contacts who've shown interest through social media engagement.

### What Counts as a Lead

- Someone who comments asking about your services
- Direct messages inquiring about pricing
- Profile visits from potential customers
- Engagement patterns that suggest interest

### Using Leads

- View contact information and which platform they came from
- See their engagement history with your content
- Track lead status (new, contacted, converted)
- Filter by platform and date

---

## 10. Trend Alerts

### What They Are

PassivePost monitors trending topics across your connected platforms. When something relevant to your business starts trending, you get an alert.

### How to Use Trend Alerts

1. You'll see trend notifications on your dashboard
2. Click on a trend to see details
3. Choose to **Generate a Post** based on the trend — the AI will create timely, relevant content
4. Schedule or post the content immediately

### Why It Matters

Trending content gets more visibility. When you post about something that's already getting attention, your content is more likely to be seen and engaged with.

---

## 11. Bulk Importing Content

### When to Use It

If you've planned a week or month of content in advance (in a spreadsheet, notes app, etc.), you can import it all at once instead of creating posts one by one.

### How It Works

1. Go to the Posts page
2. Click **Bulk Import**
3. Provide your post data (content, platform, schedule)
4. PassivePost validates and creates all posts
5. Posts appear in your Queue and Calendar

---
