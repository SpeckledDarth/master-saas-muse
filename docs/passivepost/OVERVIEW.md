# PassivePost — Product Overview

**AI-Powered Social Media Scheduling for Solopreneurs and Small Businesses**

---

## What is PassivePost?

PassivePost is a SaaS tool that helps solopreneurs, gig workers, and small business owners manage their social media presence without the cost of hiring a social media manager. It uses AI to generate on-brand content, schedule posts across 10 platforms, track engagement, and surface leads — all from a single dashboard.

Think of it as a personal social media assistant: you tell it about your business, your voice, and your audience, and it handles the rest.

---

## The Problem

Small business owners know they should be active on social media, but most don't have:

- **Time** to create content consistently
- **Budget** to hire a social media manager ($3,000–$5,000/month)
- **Expertise** to know what to post, when to post, and where to post
- **Tools** that are affordable and simple enough for a one-person operation

The result? Inconsistent posting, missed opportunities, and a social media presence that doesn't reflect the quality of their work.

## The Solution

PassivePost solves this by combining:

1. **AI content generation** — Creates posts tailored to your business niche, brand voice, and audience
2. **Multi-platform scheduling** — Manages content across Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, Snapchat, and Discord
3. **Smart automation** — Queues, calendars, and scheduled publishing keep your accounts active without daily effort
4. **Engagement analytics** — See what's working, what's not, and where your audience is growing
5. **Lead tracking** — Surface potential customers from social interactions
6. **Blog cross-posting** — Publish long-form content to Medium, WordPress, LinkedIn Articles, Ghost, and Substack, then auto-generate social snippets to drive traffic back
7. **Content flywheel** — A 38-feature system across 7 phases that makes your content marketing smarter, more automated, and more profitable over time
8. **Revenue & ROI tracking** — Measure the actual business value of your social media efforts
9. **Team collaboration** — Client approval portals and shared content workflows for agencies

## What Makes PassivePost Different

### 1. Built for Non-Technical Users
No complex setup, no API keys to manage, no learning curve. Connect your accounts, set your brand voice, and start generating content.

### 2. Industry-Specific AI
Generic social media tools generate generic content. PassivePost's niche guidance system produces content that sounds like it was written by someone who actually works in your industry.

### 3. Affordable for Solo Operators
Enterprise social media tools start at $99/month and up. PassivePost is designed to be accessible for businesses with tighter budgets.

### 4. Complete Workflow
Most tools do either content creation OR scheduling OR analytics. PassivePost covers the entire workflow: generate → schedule → publish → analyze → improve.

### 5. Passive Content Growth (The Blog-to-Social Flywheel)
Write one blog post, and PassivePost automatically generates 5-7 social media snippets with links back to the article. Your blog drives social engagement, and social drives blog traffic — a self-reinforcing growth loop. The key insight: **blog content works for you passively**. A single article, once repurposed, generates weeks of social posts without additional effort. Plus, 38 intelligent features across content grading, automation, distribution optimization, ROI tracking, and team collaboration make your entire content strategy smarter over time.

Each cycle produces better content, more engagement, and more passive growth — the system gets smarter the more you use it.

## Technology

PassivePost is built on the MuseKit SaaS template, which provides:

- **Authentication**: Email/password, OAuth, SSO/SAML via Supabase
- **Billing**: Stripe subscriptions with automatic tier resolution
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full configuration without code changes
- **Email**: Transactional emails via Resend
- **Queue System**: BullMQ with Upstash Redis for background jobs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security
- **Deployment**: Vercel with auto-deploy on git push

PassivePost adds its own layer on top: social platform API clients, AI content generation, engagement analytics, and the brand voice system. All PassivePost code is cleanly separated from the MuseKit core, making it easy to maintain and extend.
