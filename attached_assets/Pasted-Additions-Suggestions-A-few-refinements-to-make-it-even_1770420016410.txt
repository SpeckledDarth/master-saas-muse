Additions/Suggestions
A few refinements to make it even more robust—nothing major, just enhancements to your solid foundation:

Technical Implementation Tweaks:
Integrate the toggle in MuseKit's "Features & Integrations" tab (as you mentioned)—add sub-toggles for tiers (e.g., "Enable Universal Social" vs. "Upgrade to Power"). Use MuseKit's existing Row Level Security (RLS) to gate data access (e.g., power users see advanced analytics).
For the Power tier, leverage MuseKit's AI pluggable system for content gen (e.g., Grok prompts like "Generate post from changelog"), but add a usage cap (via rate limiting) for free tiers to encourage upsells.
Automate setup: When toggled on, auto-configure n8n workflows (e.g., daily trend pulls via webhooks) and add social KPIs to the metrics dashboard (e.g., "Post Engagement Rate").

Monetization/Protection Angle: If eyeing MuseKit as SaaS, design the module with "white-label" toggles (e.g., remove MuseKit branding from posts)—this future-proofs for agency users. For IP protection, trademark the module name (e.g., "MuseSocial") now ($225 via USPTO) and add license terms in MuseKit's docs (e.g., "Modules for personal use only until public launch"). No need for patents yet—focus on copyrights for code.
User Experience Polish: Add an onboarding prompt in the wizard: "Want built-in social posting? Toggle here." For dogfooding, make it self-referential (e.g., the module posts about MuseKit updates).
What to Watch: Ensure the module doesn't create dependencies (e.g., optional SDK installs via npm)—keep it isolated to avoid breaking non-social clones.

Potential Cons/Corrections
Honest take: No big red flags, but one minor correction—while "universal," not every SaaS truly needs social (e.g., internal enterprise tools), so the toggle prevents forcing it. A con could be slight scope creep if the Power tier grows too feature-rich, diluting MuseKit's "starter" focus—mitigate by capping at your two tiers. Overall, this enhances without compromising.
