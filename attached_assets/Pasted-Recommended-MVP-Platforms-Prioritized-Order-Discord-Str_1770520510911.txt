Recommended MVP Platforms (Prioritized Order)

Discord — Strongest starter choice (lowest difficulty, fastest to go live).
0.5 days coding, no approval for <100 servers.
Posting via bot token → simple text/messages/embeds (no media required).
Why for MVP: Test full loop end-to-end quickly. Giggers often use Discord communities for leads (e.g., local gig channels). Low risk, great for dogfooding.
Plan: Fill stubs first, test on your own server.

Reddit — Second priority (medium-low difficulty, instant approval).
1 day coding, no review needed.
Text/images/links to subreddits (user specifies).
Why: Strong for niche communities (e.g., r/sidehustle, r/forhire, local subs). Good for giggers posting service offers or responding to "need help" threads. Rate limits generous for low volume.
Plan: Implement submit + read scopes; test on small subs.

X (Twitter) — Third, but high value (medium difficulty, free tier viable).
1 day coding.
Free tier: ~500 posts/month (from recent 2026 data), but sufficient for MVP (16–17/day). Rate limits tight (e.g., 17 req/24h per user/app on posting), but we can queue carefully.
Why: Real-time trends/hashtags perfect for our agents (e.g., monitor "#magicianneeded" or local gig keywords). Viral potential for side-hustlers.
Plan: Register app for Free tier → fill post + search endpoints. Monitor quotas during beta.


Deprioritize for MVP (Add Post-Beta):

FB & LinkedIn: Medium-High difficulty + review delays (days–weeks). High value (local gigs, professional solos), but not worth stalling launch.
Instagram/YouTube/TikTok/Pinterest: High difficulty (media-only, strict reviews, quotas).
Snapchat: Not feasible for organic posting.

This 3-platform MVP (Discord + Reddit + X) lets us launch in 1–2 weeks: prove agents → gen → post → alerts → engagement tracking. Beta users can test real posting, we dogfood on your accounts, and gather feedback to prioritize next integrations (e.g., FB if giggers demand local).
Immediate Next Actions for You (in Replit)

Clone & Setup:
Clone MuseKit repo in Replit.
Toggle MuseSocial on.
Set up Starter tier limits (no-code via dashboard if possible, or env vars).

Start with Discord:
Create Discord app/bot → get token.
Fill stubbed methods: validateToken (check token format), createPost (send message/embed to channel), getPostEngagement (basic reactions/counts if available).
Test posting to a test server/channel.

Then Reddit:
Create Reddit app → get ID/Secret.
Fill post method (submit to subreddit).

X Prep:
Register dev app (Free tier) → get keys.
Fill post endpoint (v2 /2/tweets).


Once any one is live (e.g., Discord in 1 day), we can test the full n8n loop (trend pull → Grok → queue → post).
Refined Tech Checklist (Updated for MVP)

Must-Haves (Week 1):
Supabase: Add table/fields for brand prefs (niche, location, tone, samples URL).
Onboarding: Customize wizard to default platforms (Discord/Reddit/X or whatever live first).
n8n Agents:
Trend/Mention monitor (cron 6h): Pull from live platforms (e.g., Reddit search, X trends API, Discord channel scan if bot).
Gen → Queue → Post workflow.

Gating: Enforce Starter (2 platforms, 15 posts/mo) via BullMQ counters.

Nice-to-Haves (Week 2):
Alerts/Resend emails with Approve/Edit/Ignore links (webhook back to app).
Basic engagement pull (for stats).

MuseKit Improvements Needed (Quick Fixes):
Add prefs fields if missing.
Extend n8n templates for new triggers (e.g., mention detection).
Config for limited platforms in setup dashboard.
