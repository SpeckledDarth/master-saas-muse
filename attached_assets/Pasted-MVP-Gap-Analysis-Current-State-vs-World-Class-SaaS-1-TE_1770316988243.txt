MVP Gap Analysis: Current State vs. World-Class SaaS
1. TEAMS FEATURE
Current State
What Exists	Status
Add/Edit/Delete team members	Working
Role assignment (owner/manager/member/viewer)	Working
Send invitations	Working (glitchy)
Cancel invitations	Working
Permission-based UI (who can see what)	Working
Gaps to World-Class
Missing	Impact	Priority
Team members can't access dashboard	CRITICAL - Defeats purpose of teams	P0
Invitation acceptance flow is glitchy	Poor UX	P1
No invitation email branding	Unprofessional	P2
No "resend invitation" button	Admin frustration	P3
No team activity log	Audit trail missing	P3
Root Cause (Likely)
The /api/user/membership API checks organization_id = 1 which may not match how invitations create team records. Need to trace the full flow.

Current State
What Exists	Status
Page exists	Shows empty

No "profiles" table in database?	Root cause	P0
No user deletion	Admin limitation	P2

Root Cause (Likely)
The page queries a profiles table that may not exist or has no data. Need to verify database schema.
