High-Impact, Low-Effort (Add Now if Possible — Quick Wins)

Gig Lead Notifications:
Auto-scan mentions/replies for "need [niche]" keywords (e.g., "need magician in NYC") via n8n. Alert via email/push with "Reply Now" link.
Why: Turns passive into active leads — huge USP for giggers.
Effort: Extend alert-and-approve workflow; use X/FB search APIs (already stubbed).
Upsell: Premium gets priority alerts + auto-reply templates.

Hashtag Optimizer:
AI-suggest 3–5 hashtags per post based on niche/location/trends (pull from X trends).
Why: Boosts reach without manual research — giggers hate hashtag hunts.
Effort: Add to buildSocialPrompt() or separate endpoint; low-code.
Upsell: Basic+ gets unlimited; Free limited to 3.

Post Performance Tips:
After pulling engagement (BullMQ job), AI-analyze low-performers (e.g., "This post got low likes — try shorter captions next time"). Show in engagement dashboard.
Why: "Coaching" USP — makes users better over time, increases retention.
Effort: Grok prompt on engagement_data JSONB; add card in dashboard.
Upsell: Premium gets personalized weekly summaries.


Medium-Impact, Medium-Effort (Add Post-Beta if Users Ask)

Content Repurposer:
Take one post → AI-gen variants for other platforms (e.g., short tweet → longer LinkedIn).
Why: Saves time for cross-posting — giggers want one idea, many channels.
Effort: New dialog in queue/editor; extend AI pipeline.
USP: "One post, everywhere" flywheel.

Local Event Scanner:
n8n cron scans FB events/X for niche-relevant local happenings (e.g., "kids party in NYC" for magicians) → gen promo post.
Why: Proactive leads — turns "passive" into "opportunity-spotter."
Effort: New workflow template; use location from prefs.
Upsell: Premium gets daily scans vs. weekly.

Collaborator Mode:
Invite 1–2 team members (e.g., VA for approvals) on Premium.
Why: For growing giggers who hire help — adds B2B angle without complexity.
Effort: Leverage MuseKit orgs; add RLS for shared queues.
USP: "Scale your passive empire."

Why: That "passive post" name upside — content marketing loop.
USP: "Social to blog to leads — all passive."

AI Voice Fine-Tuner:
Upload 5–10 sample posts → Grok analyzes/creates custom prompt template.
Why: Next-level personalization — giggers get "my exact voice."
